### Introduction
&#8195; We use a Kinect camera to create a human body dataset with 2136 RGB-D images which consists of 10 postures, including upright, walking, sitting, bending, arms raising slightly, unrolling arms, arms over head, waving hands, clapping and having a waistline. There are 14 volunteers in our dataset. They can stand anywhere with arbitrary clothes. Their heights ranges from 158cm to 184cm, which covers a wide range of height. The following figure shows some examples:

##### Composition and division of our data set
&#8195; Our entire dataset is divided into three parts: part A, B and C. Part A is the training set with 1707 images. partB and C together forms the test set with totally 429 images.

&#8195;We ﬁrst divide 1767 images from 12 people  into two parts: part A and B . Part A has 1707 images to form the training set. PartB, denoted as Familiar-test, has 60 images and is part of the test set. Network may recognize the identity information from the image of Part B.  
&#8195;The 369 images of all the other volunteers are part C, denoted as Strange-test. It is impossible for network to recognize any identity information from part C since none of them appears in the training set. It will be very easy to determine whether the network has learned identity information or body height under such a data set conﬁguration. It only need to compare the difference of accuracy between part B and C.
