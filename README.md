### Introduction
We use a Kinect camera to create a human body dataset with 2136 RGB-D images which consists of 10 postures, including upright, walking, sitting, bending, arms raising slightly, unrolling arms, arms over head, waving hands, clapping and having a waistline. There are 14 volunteers in our dataset. They can stand anywhere with arbitrary clothes. Their heights ranges from 158cm to 184cm, which covers a wide range of height.
